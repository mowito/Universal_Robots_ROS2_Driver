    Base UR robot series xacro macro.

    NOTE this is NOT a URDF. It cannot directly be loaded by consumers
    expecting a flattened '.urdf' file. See the top-level '.xacro' for that
    (but note that .xacro must still be processed by the xacro command).

    This file models the base kinematic chain of a UR robot, which then gets
    parameterised by various configuration files to convert it into a UR3(e),
    UR5(e), UR10(e) or UR16e.

    NOTE the default kinematic parameters (i.e., link lengths, frame locations,
    offsets, etc) do not correspond to any particular robot. They are defaults
    only. There WILL be non-zero offsets between the Forward Kinematics results
    in TF (i.e., robot_state_publisher) and the values reported by the Teach
    Pendant.

    For accurate (and robot-specific) transforms, the 'kinematics_parameters_file'
    parameter MUST point to a .yaml file containing the appropriate values for
    the targeted robot.

    If using the UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver, follow the steps
    described in the readme of that repository to extract the kinematic
    calibration from the controller and generate the required .yaml file.
